BRZ is a bit of a sensitive animal, considering they are using toyota-esque Column, and half its canbus.

ZZYY is speed.
WW is counter 00-FF

0x0D4 0xZZ 0xYY 0xZZ 0xYY 0xZZ 0xYY 0xZZ 0xYY - 20ms

0x0D3 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xWW - 200ms

Notes: 

Make sure to send speed as 0 for the first second of communication. Otherwise Column will remain fully off.
Value of speed for min - max assist is 0 - 3500 in int8. Didn't bother decoding offset and multiplier. 
Timing of messages IS IMPORTANT. This bastard actually cares about it.

BRZ/FRS/GT86 COLUMNS SUCK FOR AUTOCROSS OR PROLONGED TORQUE APPLIED TO WHEEL. THEY CUT OUT. This is easily fixed on prius controllers. 
Highly do not recommend ever using these in swaps.

If you are using this information for financial gain, please do me a favor and credit nmstec.ca for it.
I am doing this purely because theres not many customers actually caring about using BRZ columns as they are overpriced.
